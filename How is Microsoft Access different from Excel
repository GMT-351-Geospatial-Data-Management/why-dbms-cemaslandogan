Both Microsoft Excel and Access can be used to store data, so they may look similar. But in reality they are quite different.

Excel is a spreadsheet program primarily used for individual projects and for doing short calculations. Most Excel users only work with a
few dozen to a few hundred data cells at a time. Excel is great for graphing and charting these calculations and data points.

Microsoft Access, on the other hand, was built to store and manage huge amounts of data in a way that makes it easy to retrieve and use
in different applications. Access databases are manipulated with pre-made forms and queries, while Excel users type directly into their
spreadsheets. Most businesses also connect Access to other apps, so when those other apps create data, it's automatically imported into Access.
