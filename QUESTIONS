What kind of spatial and thematic data you store?
Raster height, vector data, 3D geographic data are available in our
repositories. Raster height, 3D geographic data are stored on ArcGIS servers, and vector data are stored on PostgreSQL, PostGIS, MSQL servers.

Do you use a DBMS? If so, which one(s)?
 Yes we use DBMS.

 Is it a relational database? If so how many tables do you have?
We use MSQL and PostgreSQL relational databases.

If so how many tables do you have?
We have too many tables. There is a separate table  for each project.

Why do you think the use of DBMS is important? What is the main benefit to your operation/product/daily use?
DBMS allows us to organize and collect our own data. It facilitates the management of data, enables us to query the data.
It transforms the data from a dispersed structure to a central structure. Thanks to the History, the changes made by the employees are visible.

What do you think is the main source of trouble in using a DBMS?
If you define the system and relational structures well, you will not encounter any problems.
We do the design part (Database First) part carefully. We do not throw data directly into it, we create tables.

Assume you have a team of Geomatics Engineers. Consider that employee A has very good skills in databases and programming
 and employee B does not possess these skills. Considering that you have the financial freedom and that
 you paying X TL to employee B; how much would you pay to employee A?

I would pay employee A 1.5 or 2 times the amount of money I paid employee B.
